Great mindset! Understanding the logic behind a project helps you write your own code confidently. Here's the **logic behind the To-Do List project**, broken down into **core concepts**:

---

## 🔍 Project: To-Do List (Command Line)

### 🎯 Objective:

Let users manage a simple task list: add, view, mark done, delete tasks — all from the terminal.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts/Logic:

### 1. **Data Storage**

* Use a **list** to store tasks.
* Each task can be represented as a **dictionary**:

  ```python
  {"task": "Buy milk", "done": False}
  ```
* This allows storing both **task content** and its **completion status**.

---

### 2. **Menu Display**

* Use a loop to keep showing a **menu of options**:

  * Add
  * View
  * Mark Done
  * Delete
  * Exit
* Ask user for a choice using `input()`.

---

### 3. **Adding a Task**

* Ask user to enter a task string.
* Create a dictionary like `{"task": "Your Task", "done": False}`.
* Append it to the list.

---

### 4. **Viewing Tasks**

* Loop over the list using `enumerate()`.
* Print each task with:

  * Task number
  * Task content
  * Status: "Done" or "Pending"

---

### 5. **Marking Task as Done**

* First show the list so user can choose a task number.
* Convert user input to the list index: `index = number - 1`.
* Change `"done"` value to `True` for that dictionary.

---

### 6. **Deleting a Task**

* Same as mark done: show tasks and take input.
* Use `list.pop(index)` to remove the task.

---

### 7. **Looping Until Exit**

* Use a `while True:` loop to keep running.
* Exit only when user selects the "Exit" option.

---

## 🧱 Summary of Logic Flow:

```
Start loop
│
├─ Show Menu
│
├─ Ask for user's choice
│
├─ If 1: Add Task → Append new task to list
│
├─ If 2: View Tasks → Loop through and display tasks
│
├─ If 3: Mark Done → Ask task number, set 'done' = True
│
├─ If 4: Delete Task → Ask task number, remove from list
│
└─ If 5: Exit loop
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Your Version:

* You can use only strings instead of dictionaries if you want a simpler version (but won’t track "done"/"pending").
* Try saving tasks to a file (`open`, `write`, `readlines`) to make them persistent.
